# Notakto
Notakto Implementation in Python

## Introduction
Notakto(a.k.a 3-board misère Tic-Tac-Toe) is a two-player game similar to classic Tic-Tac-Toe, except that:

a) Both players play 'X';

b) The player who make the last move loses the game


## Implementation
In this repository, 3-board misère Tic-Tac-Toe is implemented in Python together with Artificial Intelligence.

The AI is developed using the optimal strategy introduced in [**Secrets of 3-Board Tic-Tac-Toe - Numberphile**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h09XU8t8eUM).

## Get started
```
$ python solveTicTacToe.py
```
